Social networks model relationships between individuals as nodes and edges. 
This project analyzes a friendship graph to study its structural properties. 
Key tasks include graph construction, visualization, centrality analysis, community detection, and
 evaluation of small-world characteristics. The goal is to uncover patterns of influence, connectivity, and 
 community structures within the network.


 Social networks help us understand how individuals are connected and interact within a group. 
 In this project, a friendship graph is analyzed to examine patterns of relationships among people.
  Each individual is represented as a node, and each friendship as an edge. 
  The analysis covers the structure of the network, identifies key individuals, detects tightly connected communities, 
  and checks if the network displays small-world behavior. Through this, we aim to gain meaningful insights into the dynamics of
   the social group.


Social networks model individuals relationships with others in a perticular group. Each individual is represented as a node, and each friendship as an edge.
In this project, a friendship graph of CS-22 is analyzed to examine patterns of relationships among students of CS-22.
Key tasks include graph construction, visualization, centrality analysis, community detection, and
evaluation of small-world characteristics. Through this, we aim to gain meaningful insights into the dynamics of
the social group.

Final:
"Social networks model individuals' relationships with others in a particular group. Each individual is represented as a node, and each friendship as an edge.
In this project, a friendship graph of CS-22 is analyzed to examine patterns of relationships among students of that batch.
Key tasks include graph construction, visualization, centrality analysis, community detection, and evaluation of small-world characteristics. Through this, we aim to gain meaningful insights into the dynamics of the social group."
